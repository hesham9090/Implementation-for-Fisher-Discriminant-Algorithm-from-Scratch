Implementation for Fisher Discriminant Algorithm from Scratch

You are required to design a Fisher’s linear discriminant classifier that can recognize scanned
images of the 10 digits (0 to 9) provided in the file “Dataset.zip”. The zip file
contains two folders: “Train” and “Test”. The “Train” folder contains 240 images for each
digit while the “Test” folder contains 20 images for each digit. The images in the “Train”
folder should be used to train a classifier for each digit . The folder contains a filed named “Training Labels.txt” which
includes the labels of the 2400 images in order. After the classifiers are trained, test each
classifier using the images given in the “Test” folder. Use the following equation for Fisher’s
Linear Discriminant. The folder also contains a text file named “Test
Labels.txt” which include the labels of the 200 images in order.

Deliverables:
• Your code.
• A confusion matrix showing the number of images of the Test folder of each digit
that were classified to belong to different digits (For example: Number of images of 0
that were classified as 0, 1, 2, …, 9, and so on for other digits). Convert the
confusion matrix to an image and save it as “Confusion.jpg”.
